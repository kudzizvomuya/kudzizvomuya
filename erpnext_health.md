# Why should you utilize an enterprise resource planning system for human resource management?

Managing your staff effectively is critical to guaranteeing the success of your company. This necessitates providing them with the tools and mechanisms that will allow them to do their duties in the most efficient manner feasible. By incorporating an HRM module into your ERP system, you will automate a variety of activities and procedures that are associated with managing a group of coworkers or employees. It enables you to keep track of a variety of employee-relations tasks, including but not limited to:

    1. Recruitment
    2. Payroll
    3. Leave Management
    4. Employee Lifecycle
    5. Attendance claims 
    6. Expense claims

Payroll processing and the leave management tasks are the most utilized features. The majority of countries have complicated tax laws that specify the expenditures that a business may incur on its workers' behalf (e.g., social security, taxes). All of this is taken into consideration by 
ERPNext’s HR module 

# Understanding the ERPNext's HRM


## Recruitment Make a plan for your future staff.
When it comes to the hiring of new workers, there are many moving elements to consider. 
An HRM system may assist you in this process by allowing you to develop staffing plans,
which can then be used to forecast your company's personnel needs. When developing a staffing plan, 
you may include information such as budgets, vacancies, anticipated cost per job, number of roles, and so on.

The recruiting procedure is a time-consuming process.
When a position becomes available at your business, the following steps are typically followed:

** When you post a job opportunity, individuals will come and apply for it.
** Participants in the job application process (in certain cases, they may have been referred to you by another employee!)
** Interviews are performed with the candidates.

Once you've decided on someone, you make them an offer of employment (this states the offered salary package, designation, grade, department, number of leave days, etc.).
If they agree, they will be granted an offer appointment letter.
Each of these stages is recorded in the HRM module of ERPNEXT, allowing you to keep track of everything as it progresses.

## Leave Management

The procedure for submitting a leave application
Everyone needs a break from time to time. Using an enterprise resource planning system to manage leaves allows you to effectively handle the leave calendar of your company. According to the company's leave policy, the number and kind of absences that may be requested by employees via a leave application are limited by their individual leave allotment for a leave term.

### Types of Leaves and the Encashment of Leaves
Leaves may be classified according to their kind, with each type having its own set of rules. For example:

    • What is the maximum number of leaves that may be used?
    • What is the maximum number of consecutive days of leave that may be taken?
    • Is the leave considered unpaid leave? 
    • Is taking a leave of absence mandatory?
    • Is it possible to have a negative leave balance while on leave?
    • Is it true that the leave type includes holidays as part of the leave?
    • Is it a kind of compensation?
    • 
Employees who have accumulated leave days are eligible to receive leave encashment, which is a sum of money received by an employee in exchange for leave
days that have accumulated overtime.Additionally, employees who have been working overtime or on holidays may be eligible to seek compensatory time off, depending on your company's rules. 
You may also add extra leave days if your employee has exhausted their allocated vacation time and are permitted to take additional (and often unpaid) vacation time.

## Holiday List
A holiday list, which includes the dates of all holidays observed by the business, may also be kept on hand for reference. Multiple lists may be generated and allocated to workers in order to accommodate differences between various locations or departments. Having a leave block list, on the other hand, consolidates all of the days in a year during which workers are not permitted to request time off.

## Attendance and Shift Management

A record of attendance is a document that indicates whether or not an employee was present on a particular day.
Most enterprise resource planning systems include an employee attendance tool that allows you to track the attendance of multiple employees on a specific date.
In the unlikely event that an employee's attendance was not recorded, they may file an attendance request to ensure that the proper changes are made to 
the records.

You may also keep track of the specifics of your shifts. A shift is defined as the span of time that an employee clocks in and out over the course of his or

her workday. Working shifts are beneficial in that they allow you to keep a constant uptime of working hours by rotating the task between various workers at
different times of day. This allows them to relieve one other of the burden of the job while also ensuring that the work does not come to a complete stop. 
(For example, a customer service representative may work a day shift, and when it is time for them to go home, they are relieved by the person who takes over
the job at night.)

Shift type, which is determined by the kinds of shifts available in your company, may be included as part of the attendance data for each employee. When someone checks in for a shift using the employee check-in feature, the system may automatically record their attendance. Alternatively, if an employee wishes to request a specific shift type, they can use the shift requests feature. Once a shift request has been submitted, the employee's shift assignments are updated accordingly.

During the process of configuring the human resources module or adding bulk attendance, you can make use of the ERPNext's built-in upload attendance tool, which works with the.Csv template that your implementor provides you with.

Lifecycle and Salary Lifecycle are two terms that are used interchangeably.
It is possible to record and track the series of changes, growth, and developments that an employee will go through during their tenure with your company. This is the progression of their existence.

Employee Onboarding is a term that refers to the process of bringing new employees on board. Getting started with employee onboarding, which is the process of hiring and providing an employee with the training they need to become a productive member of your organization, is important. For each job application that is approved, a set of tasks is created for that individual. The following are examples of onboarding tasks: conducting a legal and professional background check, creating an employee document in the ERP system (including setting up an email account), creating an identity card, allocating leaves, and so forth

Appraisals and employee skill maps are two important tools. Next comes performance appraisals, which are a kind of evaluation in which an employee's work performance is recorded and assessed. Employee appraisals may be structured around key result areas (KRAs), which are based on the organization's strategic objectives. Some ERP systems allow you to create employee skill maps, which are records that help your organization track and evaluate the skill sets and training received by your employees. This information can also be used in the process of evaluating candidates.

## Promotions for employees
After appraisals and evaluations have been completed, it is time for the employee to progress in his or her career. This document is created when an employee advances in their career within your organization and is assigned a greater share of responsibilities, a higher pay scale, or a combination of these two factors.

## Employee Transfer

When an employee is transferred from one department or unit to another, or when he or she takes on new responsibilities or moves to a new location, you can create an employee transfer document for them. Detailed information about the changes that are taking place, such as the transfer date, is entered and stored.

## Employees termination
When it comes time for an employee to depart from your company, human resources must complete a number of tasks. Using an employee separation document, you can streamline the exit process (which includes things such as gathering company property, paying any outstanding bills, collecting any identification cards, disabling access to systems, deleting the email account, and so on). It establishes a list of tasks that must be completed in order to complete the separation process.

## Payroll
It is critical for every business to have a reliable payroll process 
in place. Employees should be able to look foward to receive their wages on a consistent basis at all times. It is the total sum of all compensation that a company 
is required to pay to its employees for a specified period of time or on a specific date.

### Typically, the ERPNext's HRM module allows you to do the following:

    • Define a pay period for your employees.
    • Specify the income tax brackets.
    • Create a pay structure that includes compensation components (i.e. earnings and deductions).
    • Assign different salary structures to different employees.
    • Payslip generation.
    • Record salary payments in your accounting records.
